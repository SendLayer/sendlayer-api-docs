## Prerequisites
Before getting started, you'll need to:
1. Authorize your [sending domain](https://sendlayer.com/docs/authorizing-your-domain/)
2. Create and retrieve your [SendLayer API key](https://sendlayer.com/docs/managing-api-keys/)

## Installation
Install the SendLayer Python SDK using the command:

```bash
pip install sendlayer
```

## Usage
After the installation completes, you're ready to start integrating the SDK to your code. The SDK includes modules to send emails, manage webhooks and events.


### Sending an Email
Create a new `.py` file or edit an existing one. Then import the `SendLayer` module. Once done, you'll need to initialize the module with your SendLayer API key.

```python send_email.py
from sendlayer import SendLayer

# Initialize the email client with your API key
sendlayer = SendLayer("your-api-key")

# Send an email
response = sendlayer.Emails.send(
    to="recipient@example.com",
    sender="sender@example.com",
    subject="Test Email",
    text="This is a test email"
)
```

#### Sending HTML Emails
To send HTML emails, simply include the `html` parameter to the `send()` method. 

```python send_email.py
from sendlayer import SendLayer

# Initialize the email client with your API key
sendlayer = SendLayer("your-api-key")

# Send an email
response = sendlayer.Emails.send(
    to="recipient@example.com",
    sender="sender@example.com",
    subject="Test Email",
    html="<html><body><p>This is a test email sent with the <a href='https://sendlayer.com'>SendLayer</a> API!</p></body></html>"
)
```

<Note>You can include the `text` parameter to have a plain text and HTML version of your email message</Note>

#### Sending to Multiple Recipients
You can send emails to multiple recipients including `"Cc"` and `"BCC"` email addresses.

```python send_email.py
from sendlayer import SendLayer

sendlayer = SendLayer(api_key='your-api-key')


# Send to multiple recipients
response = sendlayer.Emails.send(
    to=[
        {'email': 'recipient1@example.com', 'name': 'Recipient 1'},
        {'email': 'recipient2@example.com', 'name': 'Recipient 2'}
    ],
    sender={'email':'sender@example.com', 'name': 'Sender Name'},
    subject='Complex Email',
    html='<p>This is a <strong>test email</strong>!</p>',
    text='This is a test email!',
    cc=[{'email': 'cc@example.com', 'name': 'CC Recipient'}],
    bcc=[{'email': 'bcc@example.com', 'name': 'BCC Recipient'}],
    reply_to=[{'email': 'reply@example.com', 'name': 'Reply To'}],
)
```
Each recipient field is an array containing the recipient's `name` and `email` as objects. 

<Note>There are limits to the number of email recipients you can add to a single request. See our [rate limiting](/api-reference/rate-limit) guide to learn more.</Note>

#### Including Attachments
You can include attachments to your email message by adding the `attachments` parameter to the email payload.

```python send_email.py
from sendlayer import SendLayer

sendlayer = SendLayer(api_key='your-api-key')


# Send email with attachments
response = sendlayer.Emails.send(
    to=[
        {'email': 'recipient1@example.com', 'name': 'Recipient'},
    ],
    sender={'email': 'sender@example.com', 'name': 'Sender Name'},
    subject='Complex Email',
    html='<p>This is a <strong>test email</strong>!</p>',
    attachments=[{
        'path': 'path/to/file.pdf',
        'type': 'application/pdf',
    }]
)
```

<Warning>The maximum email size SendLayer allows is 10MB. This includes both the message as well as attachment files.</Warning>

Simply replace the `path` parameter with the path to the attachment file you wish to attach and specify the correct `type`. 

SendLayer SDK supports both local and remote file attachments and allows you to add multiple attachment files. See our tutorial to learn more about [attaching files to emails](/guides/send-email-with-attachments).

### Managing Webhooks
With the SendLayer Python SDK, you can create new webhook, view all webhooks you've created and also delete a specific webhook.

#### Creating a New Webhook
To create a new webhook, you'll need to first import the SendLayer module and initialize it with your API key.

Then call the `Webhooks.create()` method and specify the required parameters. This method requires the `url` and `event` parameters.

```python webhooks.py
from sendlayer import SendLayer

sendlayer = SendLayer(api_key='your-api-key')

# Create a webhook
webhook = sendlayer.Webhooks.create(
    url='https://your-domain.com/webhook',
    event='open'
)
```
The `event` parameter is constrained to the following options:
- bounce
- click
- open
- unsubscribe
- complaint
- delivery

Example success response for new wehbook:

```json
{
   "NewWebhookID": 23718
}
```

#### Getting All Webhooks
To view all the webhooks you've created, use the `Webhooks.get()` method.

```python webhooks.py
from sendlayer import SendLayer

sendlayer = SendLayer(api_key='your-api-key')

# Get all webhooks
webhooks = sendlayer.Webhooks.get()
```

Here is an example response:
```json
{
  "Webhooks": [
    {
      "WebhookID": "23718",
      "CreatedAt": "2025-04-11 09:43:07",
      "UpdatedAt": "2025-04-11 09:43:07", 
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "WebhookURL": "http://example.com/webhook",
      "Event": "delivered",
      "LastResponseCode": "0",
      "LastResponseBody": "",
      "LastResponseAt": "0000-00-00 00:00:00",
      "LastResponseTryCounter": "0"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Deleting a Webhook
To delete a specific webhook, use the `Webhooks.delete()` method. This method accepts one required parameter `webhook_id` that needs to be a number.

<Warning> Deleting a webhook cannot be undone. You won't be able to recover or access your webhook after deleting it.</Warning>

```python webhooks.py
from sendlayer import SendLayer

sendlayer = SendLayer(api_key='your-api-key')

# Delete a webhook
webhook_id = 23718
sendlayer.Webhooks.delete(webhook_id)
```

#### Webhooks Parameters
The table below contains details about the supported parameters in the `Webhooks` module.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `url` | `string` | Yes | The webhook endpoint URL where events will be sent |
| `event` | `string` | Yes | The type of event to listen for. Options: bounce, click, open, unsubscribe, complaint, delivery |
| `webhook_id` | `integer` | Yes | Unique identifier for the webhook (used in delete operation) |

### Retrieving Email Events
You can view all events connected to your API key. 

#### Getting All Events
To get started, import the `SendLayer` module and initialize it with your API key. Then call the `Events.get()` method to retrieve all events.

<Note> The `Events.get()` method retrieves the top 5 events in your account if no filter parameter is specified.</Note>

```python events.py
from sendlayer import SendLayer

sendlayer = SendLayer(api_key='your-api-key')

# Get all events
events = sendlayer.Events.get()
```
Example response
```json
{
  "totalRecords": 5,
  "events": [
    {
      "Event": "delivered",
      "LoggedAt": 1746340896,
      "LogLevel": "info",
      "Message": {
        "Headers": {
          "MessageId": "06e4491f-fc5a-49cb-bc57-xxxxxx",
          "From": [["", "paulie@example.com"]],
          "ReplyTo": [],
          "To": [["", "recipient@example.com"]],
          "Cc": [],
          "Bcc": []
        },
        "Size": 2004,
        "Transport": "api"
      },
      "Recipient": "recipient@example.com",
      "Reason": "Email has been delivered."
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Filtering Events
The `Events.get()` method in the `SendLayer` module accepts some optional parameters. These parameters can be used to filter the API response. Here is an example:

```python events.py
from sendlayer import SendLayer
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

sendlayer = SendLayer(api_key='your-api-key')

# Filter events for the last 4 hours
events = sendlayer.Events.get(
    start_date=datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=4),
    end_date=datetime.now(),
    event="opened"
)
```

#### Events Parameters
The table below contains details about the available parameters in the `Events` module.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `start_date` | `datetime` | No | Start date for filtering events |
| `end_date` | `datetime` | No | End date for filtering events |
| `event` | `string` | No | Filter the API request by the type of event. Supported events include: `accepted`, `rejected`, `delivered`, `opened`, `clicked`, `unsubscribed`, `complained`, `failed` |
| `message_id` | `string` | No | Filter by the email  `MessageId` |
| `start_from` | `integer` | No | Specify a starting number for the email filter |
| `retrieve_count` | `integer` | No | This parameter controls the number of event records that'll be displayed. It defaults to 5 if none is specified |

## Error Handling

The SDK provides custom exceptions for better error handling. You can import the `SendLayerError` or `SendLayerAPIError` modules, then use Python's `try` & `exception` syntax when sending your emails:

```python
from sendlayer import (
    SendLayer,
    SendLayerError,
    SendLayerAPIError,
)

sendlayer = SendLayer('your-api-key')

try:
    response = sendlayer.Emails.send(...)
except SendLayerAPIError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e.status_code} - {e.message}")
except SendLayerError as e:
    print("Error: ", e)
```

Here is an example error response:

```bash
Error: Invalid event name - 'opened' is not a valid event name
```
