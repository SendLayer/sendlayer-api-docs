Welcome to the SendLayer API endpoint reference. SendLayer provides access to its API endpoints to allow developers integrate SendLayer into their applications. Here, you'll learn about the available API endpoints and how to interact with each of the endpoints.

## Base URL

SendLayer's API follows **REST** principles. All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://console.sendlayer.com/api/v1/
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. To authenticate, you'll need to add an **Authorization** header with the content of the header being `Bearer <token>`, where token is your SendLayer API key.

To learn how to access your SendLayer API key, check out our tutorial on [managing API keys](https://sendlayer.com/docs/managing-api-keys/).

```
Authorization: 'Bearer <token>'
```
