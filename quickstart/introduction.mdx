## Overview
SendLayer API provides a playground for developers to interact with various endpoints and send API requests. With the API, you can send emails, create and manage webhooks. Additionally, you can retrieve and monitor events related to your SendLayer account.

## Getting Started
Before you can use the SendLayer API, you'll need to [authorize your domain]('https://sendlayer.com/docs/authorizing-your-domain/). Domain verification is an important steps and it helps proves domain ownership and improves email deliverability.

After authorizing your domain, you'll need to create/retrieve your [API key]('https://sendlayer.com/docs/managing-api-keys/'). An API key is used to authenticate API requests.

### Installation
Run the command below to install the SendLayer SDK:

<CodeGroup>
```bash javascript
npm install sendlayer
```
```bash python
pip install sendlayer
```
</CodeGroup>

### Sending an Email
Once, you've installed the SDK, you can import it directly into your codebase and interact with the API. Here's an example of how to send an email using the SendLayer API:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
import { NewEmail } from 'sendlayer';

// Initialize the email client
const sendlayer = new NewEmail('your-api-key');

const params = {
  from_email: 'sender@example.com',
  to:'recipient@example.com', // or array of recipients
  subject: 'Test Email',
  text: 'This is a test email'
}

// Send a simple email
const response = await sendlayer.send(params);
```

```python Python
from sendlayer import NewEmail

# Initialize the email client with your API key
sendlayer = NewEmail("your-api-key")

# Send an email
response = sendlayer.send(
    to="recipient@example.com",
    from_email="sender@example.com",
    subject="Test Email",
    text="This is a test email"
)
```

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://console.sendlayer.com/api/v1/email \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "From": {
    "name": "Paulie Paloma",
    "email": "paulie@example.com"
  },
  "To": [
    {
      "name": "Pattie Paloma",
      "email": "pattie@exampledomain.com"
    }
  ],
  "Subject": "This is the email subject",
  "ContentType": "HTML",
  "HTMLContent": "<html><body><p>This is a test email sent with the <a href=\\\"https://sendlayer.com\\\">SendLayer</a> API!</p></body></html>",
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

SendLayer API also allows you to send emails to [multiple recipients]('/guides/send-email-to-multiple-recipients), include BCC and CC addresses, [attach files]('/guides/send-email-with-attachments) to your email messages.

## Client SDKs
SendLayer offers SDK libraries for popular programming languages that simplify the process of integrating with the API. We currently offer/support the following SDKs:
