## Overview
This guide shows you how to install the SendLayer SDKs for popular languages so you can start integrating quickly. We currently provide SDKs for Node.js, Python, and PHP.

## Prerequisites
Before using the SendLayer API, make sure you've:
- Authorized your [sending domain](https://sendlayer.com/docs/authorizing-your-domain/)
- Created or retrieved your [SendLayer API key](https://sendlayer.com/docs/managing-api-keys/)

## Node.js
Install the SendLayer Node.js SDK using your preferred package manager.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install sendlayer
```

```bash yarn
yarn add sendlayer
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Validate Installation
Create a file (for example, `checkInstall.js`) and run a quick import:

```javascript checkInstall.js
import { SendLayer } from 'sendlayer';

const sendlayer = new SendLayer('your-api-key');
console.log('SendLayer initialized:', !!sendlayer);
```

<Note>Replace `'your-api-key'` with your actual API key. See our [Node.js SDK guide](/sdks/nodejs) for full usage examples.</Note>

## Python
Install the SendLayer Python SDK via `pip`:

```bash
pip install sendlayer
```

#### Validate Installation
Create a file (for example, `check_install.py`) and run:

```python check_install.py
from sendlayer import SendLayer

sendlayer = SendLayer('your-api-key')
print('SendLayer initialized:', bool(sendlayer))
```

<Note>Replace `'your-api-key'` with your actual API key. See our [Python SDK guide](/sdks/python) for full usage examples.</Note>

## PHP
Install the SendLayer PHP SDK with Composer:

```bash
composer require sendlayer/sendlayer-php
```

#### Validate Installation
Create a file (for example, `checkInstall.php`) and run:

```php checkInstall.php
<?php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

use SendLayer\SendLayer;

$sendlayer = new SendLayer('your-api-key');
echo 'SendLayer initialized: ' . ($sendlayer ? 'true' : 'false');
```

<Note>Replace `'your-api-key'` with your actual API key. See our [PHP SDK guide](/sdks/php) for full usage examples.</Note>

## Next Steps
- Send your first email: [Send Email](/guides/send-email)
- Add attachments: [Send Email with Attachments](/guides/send-email-with-attachments)
- Send to multiple recipients: [Send Email to Multiple Recipients](/guides/send-email-to-multiple-recipients)
- Manage webhooks: [Managing Webhooks](/guides/manage-webhooks)
- Retrieve events: [Retrieving Email Events](/guides/get-events)

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure your environment can make outbound HTTPS requests
- Verify your API key is correct and active
- If installation fails, update your package manager (`npm`, `yarn`, `pip`, or `composer`) and try again
- Check language version requirements (Node.js 16+, Python 3.8+, PHP 7.4+)
