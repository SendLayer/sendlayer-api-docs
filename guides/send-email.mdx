## Overview
SendLayer makes it easy to send transactional and marketing emails via a simple API. This guide walks you through sending your first email using the SendLayer API, with examples for popular programming languages.

## Prerequisites
- [Authorize your domain](https://sendlayer.com/docs/authorizing-your-domain/)
- [Create or retrieve your API key](https://sendlayer.com/docs/managing-api-keys/)

## Sending an Email
After setting up your domain and API key, you can send emails using the SDK or directly via HTTP requests.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
import { SendLayer } from 'sendlayer';

const sendlayer = new SendLayer('your-api-key');

const params = {
  from: 'sender@example.com',
  to: 'recipient@example.com', // or array of recipients
  subject: 'Test Email',
  text: 'This is a test email sent using SendLayer Node.js SDK',
};

const response = await sendlayer.Emails.send(params);
```

```python Python
from sendlayer import SendLayer

sendlayer = SendLayer('your-api-key')

params = {
    "sender": "sender@example.com",
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "subject": "Sending a Test Email",
    "text": "This is a test email sent using SendLayer's Python SDK" 
}

response = sendlayer.Emails.send(**params)
```

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://console.sendlayer.com/api/v1/email \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "From": {
    "name": "Paulie Paloma",
    "email": "paulie@example.com"
  },
  "To": [
    {
      "name": "Pattie Paloma",
      "email": "pattie@exampledomain.com"
    }
  ],
  "Subject": "This is the email subject",
  "ContentType": "Text",
  "PlainContent": "This is a test email sent with the SendLayer API!"
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>Replace `<apiKey>` with your actual SendLayer API key in the request header.</Warning>

You can also send to [multiple recipients](/guides/send-email-to-multiple-recipients), add CC/BCC, and [attach files](/guides/send-email-with-attachments).

SendLayer API also let's you send HTML emails. This can be useful if you'd like to use a template to send welcome emails to new users. 

To send HTML emails, simply update the `params` variable to include the `html` object. Then enter your HTML email as a string.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
const params = {
  from: 'sender@example.com',
  to: 'recipient@example.com', // or array of recipients
  subject: 'Test Email',
  html: '<html><body><p>This is a test email sent with the <a href=\"https://sendlayer.com\">SendLayer</a> API!</p></body></html>',
};
```

```python Python
params = {
    "sender": "sender@example.com",
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "subject": "Sending a Test Email",
    "html": "<html><body><p>This is a test email sent with the <a href=\"https://sendlayer.com\">SendLayer</a> API!</p></body></html>" 
}
```

```bash cURL
  --data '{
  "From": {
    "name": "Paulie Paloma",
    "email": "paulie@example.com"
  },
  "To": [
    {
      "name": "Pattie Paloma",
      "email": "pattie@exampledomain.com"
    }
  ],
  "Subject": "This is the email subject",
  "ContentType": "HTML",
  "HTMLContent": "<html><body><p>This is a test email sent with the <a href=\"https://sendlayer.com\">SendLayer</a> API!</p></body></html>"
}'
```
